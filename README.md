# Drew's Coding Playground
This Repo contains Drew's Coding Playground, kinda like CodePen or similar. It contains a Dashboard which list smaller Projects or just things i wanted to try in a Pretty but simple GUI.

It creates a perfect canvas for me to develop in by making all types of resources like (CDNs, Fonts etc.) for me available.


# Why Coding Playground why not CodePen?
**Well there are many reasons why I made this. Lemme list em!**
 - I develop inside my **preferred IDE** instead of a Web-Based Text Editor.
 - **Plugins** like Prettier or HTML Boilerplate are Available to me .
 - It creates a **real environment** to develop in.
 - Folder- Path and structure are **manageable**.
 - Most importantly, its **offline**. ( as long as you not push or commit anything)

## Creating a new "Canvas"

 1. Create a **new folder** inside the ***"Pages"*** **folder** which lays in the **main directory**.
> The created folder should act like a typical project, only the **USED** files like .css, .html etc. should lay here.
 2. Link your Landing page to the Dashboard by adding a **"list-item"** with a **"a-tag"** inside.
> The "a-tag" should contain the **main-page** *(usually index.html)* as **"href-attribute"** to the newly created folder .
 3. **Start Coding, Have Fun!**
